# About

Starting Tic-Tac-Toe Template and animations forked from https://codepen.io/HectorVilas/pen/yLjPYGX.

Inspired by his tic-tac-toe project, I was determined to create a similar clone of his project to further my understanding in css animations.

This project primarily focuses on using modules and factory functions to implement a tic-tac-toe game that can be played versus another player or an AI.
